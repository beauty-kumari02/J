WEEK – 2
Question 1

Question:
Write a Java program to find the factorial of a given number.

Program:

class Factorial {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int n = 5;
        int fact = 1;

        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            fact = fact * i;
        }

        System.out.println("Factorial of " + n + " = " + fact);
    }
}


Output:

Factorial of 5 = 120


Explanation:
Factorial of a number is the multiplication of all numbers from 1 to n.
Here: 5! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120.

Question 2

Question:
Write a Java program to print Fibonacci series up to n terms.

Program:

class Fibonacci {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int n = 7;
        int a = 0, b = 1, c;

        System.out.print(a + " " + b);

        for(int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            c = a + b;
            System.out.print(" " + c);
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
    }
}


Output:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8


Explanation:
In Fibonacci series, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

Question 3

Question:
Create a Calculator class with methods add, sub, mul and div to perform arithmetic operations on two integers.

Program:

class Calculator {

    void add(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Addition = " + (a + b));
    }

    void sub(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Subtraction = " + (a - b));
    }

    void mul(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Multiplication = " + (a * b));
    }

    void div(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Division = " + (a / b));
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Calculator c = new Calculator();
        c.add(20, 10);
        c.sub(20, 10);
        c.mul(20, 10);
        c.div(20, 10);
    }
}


Output:

Addition = 30
Subtraction = 10
Multiplication = 200
Division = 2


Explanation:
Each method performs a different arithmetic operation using two integer values.
