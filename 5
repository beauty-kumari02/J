WEEK – 5
Question 1

Question:
Write a Java program to show the difference between public and private access specifier.

Program:

class AccessSpecifier {
    public int a = 10;
    private int b = 20;

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Public variable a = " + a);
        System.out.println("Private variable b = " + b);
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        AccessSpecifier obj = new AccessSpecifier();
        System.out.println("Public variable a = " + obj.a);
        // System.out.println(obj.b);  // Error: private variable
        obj.display();
    }
}


Output:

Public variable a = 10
Public variable a = 10
Private variable b = 20


Explanation:

Public members can be accessed from anywhere.

Private members can be accessed only within the same class.

Question 2

Question:
Write a Java program to show the application of the static keyword.

Program:

class StaticDemo {
    static int count = 0;

    StaticDemo() {
        count++;
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        StaticDemo s1 = new StaticDemo();
        StaticDemo s2 = new StaticDemo();
        StaticDemo s3 = new StaticDemo();

        System.out.println("Count = " + count);
    }
}


Output:

Count = 3


Explanation:
A static variable is shared among all objects of a class.

Question 3

Question:
Write a Java program to show the application of an inner class.

Program:

class Outer {
    int x = 10;

    class Inner {
        void show() {
            System.out.println("Value of x = " + x);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Outer o = new Outer();
        Outer.Inner i = o.new Inner();
        i.show();
    }
}


Output:

Value of x = 10


Explanation:
An inner class is a class defined inside another class.
It can access the data members of the outer class.
