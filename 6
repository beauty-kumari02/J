WEEK – 6
Question 1

Question:
Write a Java program to show the application of simple inheritance.

Program:

class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("This is Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("This is Child class");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Child obj = new Child();
        obj.show();
        obj.display();
    }
}


Output:

This is Parent class
This is Child class


Explanation:
In simple inheritance, one child class inherits properties of one parent class.

Question 2

Question:
Create three classes Figure, Rectangle and Square where Rectangle and Square extend Figure.
Calculate the area of Rectangle and Square.

Program:

class Figure {
    int length, breadth;

    void area() {
        System.out.println("Area not defined");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Figure {
    Rectangle(int l, int b) {
        length = l;
        breadth = b;
    }

    void area() {
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle = " + (length * breadth));
    }
}

class Square extends Figure {
    Square(int a) {
        length = a;
    }

    void area() {
        System.out.println("Area of Square = " + (length * length));
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Rectangle r = new Rectangle(5, 4);
        Square s = new Square(6);

        r.area();
        s.area();
    }
}


Output:

Area of Rectangle = 20
Area of Square = 36


Explanation:
Both Rectangle and Square inherit from the Figure class and override the area() method.

Question 3

Question:
Write a Java program to show the implementation of multilevel inheritance using Car, Maruti and Alto classes.

Program:

class Car {
    void carType() {
        System.out.println("This is a Car");
    }
}

class Maruti extends Car {
    void brand() {
        System.out.println("Brand is Maruti");
    }
}

class Alto extends Maruti {
    void model() {
        System.out.println("Model is Alto");
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Alto obj = new Alto();
        obj.carType();
        obj.brand();
        obj.model();
    }
}


Output:

This is a Car
Brand is Maruti
Model is Alto


Explanation:
In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from another class which itself is derived from another class.
