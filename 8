WEEK – 8
Question 1

Question:
Write a Java program to show the application of run-time polymorphism.

Program:

class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Animal a;
        a = new Dog();   // Runtime polymorphism
        a.sound();
    }
}


Output:

Dog barks


Explanation:
In run-time polymorphism, method call is resolved at runtime using method overriding and parent class reference.

Question 2

Question:
Write a Java program to show the use of an abstract class and abstract method.

Program:

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void area();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    int l = 5, b = 4;

    void area() {
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle = " + (l * b));
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    int r = 3;

    void area() {
        System.out.println("Area of Circle = " + (3.14 * r * r));
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Shape s;

        s = new Rectangle();
        s.area();

        s = new Circle();
        s.area();
    }
}


Output:

Area of Rectangle = 20
Area of Circle = 28.26


Explanation:

An abstract class cannot be instantiated.

An abstract method has no body and must be implemented by subclasses.
